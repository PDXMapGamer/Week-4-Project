# TODO REFLECTION

    🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
    I have achieved all the requirements and form validation strech goal.
    🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
    I couldn't achieve adding a delete and a like button to posts
    🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    Because of the layout of my site makes it impossible to fit the buttons on the mobile site without completely messing up the layout or making it even harder to read the data on a portrait, mobile screen. It was unfortunate that front end issues stopped me from working on backend strech goals but I have attempted to show further understanding by implementing validation so the site doesnt brick when fetch doesnt work, for example because of the server not being online or invalid queries being sent to the database.

I didnt use as many resources as last time as most of the things I looked up were in my previous project or week4 workshops. I just googled SQL syntax and DELETE command.
I encountered a few bugs but most of them were trivial to solve such as bad syntax, typos and forgetting to run the local server. I did run into the cors police but I somehow manage to bribe them away and don't remember how.
