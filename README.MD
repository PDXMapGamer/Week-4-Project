# TODO

    🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
    🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or dynamic CSS styling.
    🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
    🎯 Create a working POST API route in your server and fetch it from your client.
    🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
